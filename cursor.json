      "rules": [
        "Use TypeScript for all new code.",
        "Use explicit, well-named interfaces and types. Avoid `any`.",
        "Favor clarity and simplicity over abstraction.",
        "Centralize all configuration (model name, URLs, timeouts). No magic strings.",
        "Write deterministic, testable modules with pure functions where possible.",
        "Use idiomatic async/await and avoid callback-based patterns.",
        "Assume development is managed with Nix flakes; do not suggest apt, brew, yum, or global installs.",
        "Use project-local NPM scripts rather than global tools.",
        "Assume Node and dependencies are provided by `nix develop`.",
        "Default LLM is Ollama model `llama3.2:3b`.",
        "Use the official Ollama HTTP API for JS/TS clients.",
        "Implement both non-streaming and streaming LLM calls. Use async iterables for streaming.",
        "Handle connection errors clearly (e.g., Ollama not running).",
        "If model is missing, suggest `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`.",
        "Use structured outputs for LLM results: do not return raw strings unless intentional.",
        "Separate transport, retrieval, and LLM logic into clear modules.",
        "API client functions must accept explicit arguments and return structured results.",
        "Avoid hidden state; make dependencies explicit (e.g., pass config into constructors or functions).",
        "Write tests against public behavior, not internals.",
        "Use realistic mocks for HTTP and LLM responses.",
        "Keep test code clear, explicit, and readable."
